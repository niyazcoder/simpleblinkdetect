# Simple Blink Detector Using OpenCV

## Overview

This Python project uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar cascades to detect eye blinks via a webcam. It tracks and counts how many times the user blinks in real time, displaying the count both on the video feed and the console.

---

## Features

- Real-time eye detection with webcam input
- Blink detection by monitoring eye presence
- Live blink count display on video frame and terminal
- Lightweight and easy-to-understand code
- Uses OpenCV’s Haar cascade classifiers (no external models needed)

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)

---

## Why This Project?

Blink detection has practical applications in user engagement tracking, accessibility tools, and human-computer interaction. This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Work with real-time computer vision using OpenCV
- Process and analyze video input effectively
- Implement state-tracking logic for event detection
- Write clean, well-documented Python code
